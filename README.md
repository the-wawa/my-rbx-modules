# HOW TO USE
The module is to be named after the folder, the source code being stored in an "init.lua" file.
If there are any dependencies listed in the README.md file, they are to be parented in the same directory as the module itself.
As for the extra .lua files within the folder, they are to be parented to the module in the form of a ModuleScript unless stated otherwise.
